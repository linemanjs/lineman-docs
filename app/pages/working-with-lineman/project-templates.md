If you aren't sure what client-side framework you want to use for your app you may want to start with Lineman's default, framework-agnostic, project template. You can generate this project template from the command line:

```bash
$ lineman new your-project
```

Lineman then gives you some instructions on how to get up and running with this default template:

```bash
    _
   | |
   | |     _ _ __   ___ _ __ ___   __ _ _ __
   | |    | |  _ \ / _ \  _   _ \ / _  |  _ \
   | |____| | | | |  __/ | | | | | (_| | | | |
   |______|_|_| |_|____|_| |_| |_|___,_|_| |_|

- Assembling your new project directory in "/Users/davidmosher/code/your-project"
- Created a new project in "your-project/" with Lineman. Yay!

Getting started:
  1. "cd your-project" into your new project directory
  2. Start working on your project!
    * "lineman run" starts a web server at http://localhost:8000
    * "lineman build" bundles a distribution in the "dist" directory
    * "lineman clean" empties the "dist" and "generated" directories
    * "lineman spec" runs specs from the "specs" directory using testem

If you already know that you want to use a particular client-side framework (like Backbone, Ember, or Angular) we have a few framework-templates floating around to help you get up-and-running even _more_ faster.
