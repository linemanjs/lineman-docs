#### Web Server (Express JS)

Once you've generated a directory structure with the default project template, or cloned a framework project template then it's time to get developing with Lineman.

In your command-line interface:

1. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd your-project
   ```
2. Start Lineman's development environment:

   ```bash
   $ lineman run
   ```
3. Point your web-browser at _http://localhost:8000_

#### Test Runner (Testem)

Lineman integrates a full-featured test runner called Testem. Whether you are using the default project template, or have cloned a framework project template you will have a set of default tests within the `spec` directory. Lineman works by compiling all your files whenever it detects a change on disk during `lineman run`.

In another command-line interface session:

```bash
$ lineman spec
```

By default, Lineman configures Testem to re-run tests on every file change and automatically launches Chrome to execute tests using a generated Jasmine specrunner html file:

```bash
TEST'EM 'SCRIPTS!
Open the URL below in a browser to connect.
http://localhost:7357/
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
  Chrome 31.0 ┃
    1/1 ✔     ┃
              ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✔ 1 tests complete.









[Press ENTER to run tests; q to quit]
```

#### Continuous Integration (Testem)

Lineman comes pre-configured to execute your tests using Testems "CI"
mode which will run tests against PhantomJS and yield output in TAP13
format which is easy for CI environments (such as Jenkins) to consume:

[Be sure to install [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)
first!]

```bash
$ lineman spec-ci
```

The `spec-ci` command will compile your app, and then run tests within PhantomJS 1.9:

```bash
Running "spec-ci" task
ok 1 PhantomJS 1.9 - .helloText then expect(this.result).toEqual("Hello, World!").

1..1
# tests 1
# pass  1
# fail  0

Done, without errors.
```

If you'd like to output your CI report to a file, you can configure this in your
`config/application.js` like so:

``` javascript
'spec-ci': {
  options: {
    reporter: {
      type: 'xunit',
      dest: 'path/to/my/report.xml'
    }
  }
}
```

Other supported reporter types include "dot" and "tap".

#### Build Tool (Grunt)

When you are ready to bundle up your modern-client app and add the compiled JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Images, and Webfonts to your static web server you can use Lineman's build command:

```bash
$ lineman build
```

This will execute all of Lineman's `common` and `dist` phase tasks:

```bash
Running "common" task

Running "coffee:compile" (coffee) task
File generated/js/app.coffee.js created.
File generated/js/spec.coffee.js created.
>> Destination (generated/js/spec-helpers.coffee.js) not written because compiled files were empty.

Running "less:compile" (less) task
>> Destination not written because no source files were found.
File generated/css/app.less.css created.

Running "jshint:files" (jshint) task

Running "handlebars:compile" (handlebars) task
>> Destination not written because compiled files were empty.

Running "jst:compile" (jst) task

Running "concat:js" (concat) task
File "generated/js/app.js" created.

Running "concat:spec" (concat) task
File "generated/js/spec.js" created.

Running "concat:css" (concat) task
File "generated/css/app.css" created.

Running "images:dev" (images) task
Copying images to 'generated/img'

Running "webfonts:dev" (webfonts) task

Running "pages:dev" (pages) task

Running "dist" task

Running "uglify:js" (uglify) task
File "dist/js/app.js" created.

Running "cssmin:compress" (cssmin) task
File dist/css/app.css created.

Running "images:dist" (images) task
Copying images to 'dist/img'

Running "webfonts:dist" (webfonts) task
Copying webfonts to 'dist/webfonts'

Running "pages:dist" (pages) task

Done, without errors.
```

Lineman will use Grunt to execute a number of tasks and generate your production bundle in the `dist` folder at the root of your project directory, here's what the output looks like:

``` bash
$ tree dist

dist
├── css
│   └── app.css
├── favicon.ico
├── index.html
└── js
    └── app.js

```
